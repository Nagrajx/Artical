                <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is a common markup language for building a webpage's basic framework and adding features like text, graphics, tables, forms, and so forth.

                    Although HTML is a straightforward language, you must practice producing HTML code until you feel confident. Every front-end developer should also be proficient with HTML to enhance their careers. But before getting started with HTML, it's crucial to understand that since it doesn't use loops or other conditional statements or variables, it is not a programming language.
                    
                    HTML is a powerful coding language for creating websites. It is combined with CSS while designing and constructing websites. Therefore, it should go without saying that learning HTML is a necessary first step if you want to succeed in the field of Web development.</li>
